# **How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?**
This is the capstone project I completed as a part of the [Google Professional Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/LQDP7U7QB2L9?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=prof). <br/><br/>
In this project I analyzed [FitBit user data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)) and came out with useful trends to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.<br/><br/>
**About the company:** Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded **Bellabeat**, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.<br/><br/>
During and at the end of this project, I'll be producing a report with the following deliverables:

* A clear summary of the business task.
* A description of all data sources used.
* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
* A summary of my analysis.
* Supporting visualizations and key findings.
* Top high-level presentation of the recommendations based on my analysis.
